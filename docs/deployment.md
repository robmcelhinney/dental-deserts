# Deployment Targets

## Selected Targets

- Static frontend: Cloudflare Pages (primary), GitHub Pages as fallback.
- Optional thin API (future): Render.

## Current Mode

The repository is currently static-only. API work is deferred until V1/V2 needs require indexed nearby queries or operational controls.
