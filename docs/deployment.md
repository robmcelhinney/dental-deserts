# Deployment Targets

## Selected Targets

- Static frontend: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`).
- Optional thin API (future): Render.

## Current Mode

The repository is currently static-only. API work is deferred until V1/V2 needs require indexed nearby queries or operational controls.
