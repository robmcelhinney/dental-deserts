# Problem Statement

People in the UK often struggle to find an NHS dentist taking new patients, especially when moving area or trying to register children. Information is fragmented and changes quickly, so users are left calling many practices without a clear picture of local access.

This project provides a postcode-first map that combines reported NHS acceptance status with distance and area-level context (population and deprivation). It is designed to improve transparency and decision support, while clearly communicating that reported availability can be outdated and does not guarantee rapid appointments.
